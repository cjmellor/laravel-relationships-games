# Many-to-Many Relationships Example

This was made purely for me to get to grip with Laravel's model relationships.

I'm using a "Game Store" as a method, moving away from traditional methods like `User > Posts > Comments` etc.

Purely experimental and something for me to refer back to in the future.
